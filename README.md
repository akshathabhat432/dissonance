# dissonance

Dissonance is a website that represents the data set i.e., my grades in a visual and an auditory format. It uses Chart.js in order to represent a graph with
my grades from the last 4 semesters, and uses Tone.js to form a chord progression using the same, and with some background beats, produces the music that is thus played.
